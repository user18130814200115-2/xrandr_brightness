# xrandr_brightness
Change brightness with xrandr relatively to current brightness. This does not rely on backlights and is therefore primairily usefull for pc's and not for laptops. 

## usage
edit displays=(HDMI-1 DP-0) to reflect your connected display(s)  
run `brightness.sh x` where x is your modifier. This can be a value between 1 and -1.  
I reccomend using a program like sxhkm to brind these commands to a keybind.
